# error Message: missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed

when a subset cohort (matched or operated) does not include the parent cohort

# error ðŸ“„ Message: In argument: `.data$cohortId %in% subset$cohortId`.

bcs the cohort json definition does not have a conceptset defined 

try to run only with atlas cohorts and include all ther cohorts
